## About Me:  
- **Objective**: Currently in my 3rd semester of Software Engineering, super excited to grow and apply my technical skills while continuing my journey in education! 📚

## What You’ll Find Here:  
- 📁 **College Exercises and Projects**: Repositories with Python exercises 🐍, a game developed in PyGame 🎮, websites created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🌐and more!
- Personal Project - Les Pionnières Tech:  
A website created for my Web Development course, honoring women’s contributions to technology, including assistive tech. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, it follows accessibility best practices and complies with WCAG AAA guidelines. I plan to continue improving the code and expanding the project.🌷✨
