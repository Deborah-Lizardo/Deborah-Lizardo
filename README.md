- 🌺 **Motivation**: My love for tech began during my technologist degree while preparing for public service exams. The first tech-related exam I took completely changed my perspective, sparking my passion for technology.  💻💡
-  
- 🌎 **International Experience**: I've lived in four different states across Brazil and traveled extensively throughout South and North America, enriching my life with diverse cultures and expanding my language skills. 🌍✨
-   
- 🌍 **Languages**:  
  - 🇬🇧 English (C1)

## Personal Project - Les Pionnières Tech:  
🌸 A website developed independently as part of my Web Development course project. This project honors women who pioneered in assistive technology, showcasing their contributions in a male-dominated field. I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create an inclusive experience, with accessibility best practices to ensure a smooth navigation for all users. Tools like Color Contrast Analyser and Analyse Luminosity Contrast Ratio ensured compliance with WCAG AAA guidelines. The project continues evolving in both structure and interface to make a meaningful impact. 🌷✨
